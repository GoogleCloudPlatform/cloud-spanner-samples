      <h2>Explanation</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>This is an explanation of how the system works</p>
      <p>We have created a Spanner Graph Database to store the stations in the London Underground and pre-calculated all of the transit times between the stations.</p>
      <p>In addtion we have Oyster transit cards, mapped to riders and the physical addresses that they are mapped to.</p>
      <p>In our Tube system riders to not need to swipe out, but they need to swipe in.</p>
      <p>We collect every swipe and store it in the database.  We then check to see if the card has been cloned, by determining the shortest travel times between stations and flag a card if it gets somewhere faster than is possible</p>
