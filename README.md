# Spanner Sample Apps and Notebooks

This repository contains notebooks and sample apps that demonstrate how to use,
develop, and manage Spanner on Google Cloud. For additional samples by
programming language, refer to the following repositories:
- [Python](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples)
- [Node.js](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/nodejs-docs-samples)
- [Java](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/java-docs-samples)
- [Go](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/golang-samples)

See respective README files in sub-directories for details.

## Sample applications
- [ADK on knowledge graph](adk-knowledge-graph): Create a knowledge graph from documentation and YouTube videos. Use agents to create comic strips with Nano Banana to answer questions using the knowledge graph.
- [Banking](banking/README.md): Java-based application featuring AI integration, full-text search and BigQuery federation.
- [Chunking](chunking/README.md): Document chunking for RAG.
- [Finance](finance/README.md): gRPC server and workload generator to demonstrate key Spanner capabilities.
- [LoR](lor/README.md): Using Dataflow, Cloud Run and Spanner to explore Lord of the Rings characters.
- [Network Digital Twin](telco-and-csp/README.md): Advanced usage of graph to Spanner Graph to model, visualize, and query a complex telecommunications network.
- [Transit Fraud Detector](TransitFraud/README.md): Advanced usage of graph capabilities to detect fraud.


## Notebooks
Some of these notebooks are hosted in external Google Cloud repositories.

- [Graph QA Chain](https://github.com/googleapis/langchain-google-spanner-python/blob/main/docs/graph_qa_chain.ipynb): Sample notebook using LangChain to query a graph through natural language.
- [Using Graph RAG with Spanner Graph](https://github.com/googleapis/langchain-google-spanner-python/blob/main/docs/graph_rag.ipynb)
